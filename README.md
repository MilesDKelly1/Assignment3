# Assignment1
guess I will follow this and then figure out how to do a video? Making structs and enums to fit my program idea of a Dojo

# Assignment2
Change that struct to a class right now! so fun have to rewrite everything...yay

# Assignment3
github work please show my badge please - entry Assignment 3

# Assignment4
oh no we are messing with Classes. I dont like Test_Cases. Guess this textbook will be my friend by the end of this. Remember that you have all the methods made for your TEST_CASE, orginally had y.guardainName when that doesnt work due to guardainName is a private variable in JuniorStudent. So I fixed this by making a method that passes the name around. Had everything else looking fine.

#Assignment5
-Read over Chapter 12
-Made sure to keep a similar style for my TEST_CASES and Week 4 Program
-Verified that I had all the changes I need for this assignment
